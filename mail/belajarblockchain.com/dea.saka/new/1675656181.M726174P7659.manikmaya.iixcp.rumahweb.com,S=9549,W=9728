Hi Dea

As remote work is now becoming the new norm and the ASEAN region is
experiencing talent shortage or is getting hard to hire and retain
experienced talents, top companies are now onboarding internationally.

To give quick brief, here's what Deel can help you with:

   1. Create compliant contracts and onboard contractors/ full-time
   employees within a day
   2. Pay your teams in more than 120 currencies or Crypto, in a single
   transaction
   3. Integration with Quickbooks, Xero, and Netsuite, so all your payroll
   invoice data can automatically sync to that platform
   4. Leave the hassle of country-specific documentation to us along with
   the KYC check of the people you're onboarding
   5. Get automated invoices and tax receipts on the platform itself
   6. Add up perks and other benefits to your specific employees thru the
   platform


Recently, we just helped Coins.ph, AcadArena, and Axie Infinity (to name a
few) scale internationally by providing unique platform to create *localised
contracts*, *streamline payments* and *automate invoicing*, all in one
click. In other words, it would allow Belajar Blockchain to onboard and pay
their international talents in more than *150 Countries*, either
as Contractors or Employees, compliantly and within minutes.

If this could be of help, I'd love to connect so that you know what your
options are, should a need arise in the future.

P.S. I can imagine this is a busy period of the year. Either way, I
appreciate your time.

Thanks and Regards,
*Shambhavi Swarup*
