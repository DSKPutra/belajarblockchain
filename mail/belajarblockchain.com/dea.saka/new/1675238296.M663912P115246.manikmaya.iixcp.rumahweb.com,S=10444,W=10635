Hi Dea - I found you on LinkedIn while I came across Belajar Blockchain. I
noticed that you're looking to hire people in Indonesia and I wanted to
know if you've considered to have teams working for you overseas?

I'm an ASEAN Expansion expert at Deel and would love to introduce how we
can help your business growth whilst saving time and money, both.

To render a quick info, Deel is a [dashboard](https://www.deel.com/) acting
as an interface between you and teams working for you overseas.

It enables you to onboard even 1 person as a contractor or a full-time
employee within a day, in over 150+ countries while we handle KYC checks,
country compliant contracts and pay in 120+ currencies.

To quote from recent experience, teams with even 2-3 employees to 170+
started with onboarding even 1 as a full-time employee or contractor- on
fixed monthly/ hourly & project-basis, working for them.

The reason?

- They wanted to experiment the global market while having productivity (in
Tech, Sales, Consulting..) round the clock.

- saved 60-70% cost on experiments and expansion to reach global without
setting up an entity

- risk of getting in any trouble around legal or labor laws- compliant
contracts, local taxes, scope of work, probation time, termination, to name
a few.

How did it work?

They just made 1 payment to Deel every month and we managed the payroll on
their behalf, even with tax invoices automated for each person onboarded
through us.

Bottom line- you and your team can onboard and pay candidates anywhere in
just a few minutes, even if you do not have an entity in a region.

I was thinking if this aligns with your business growth plans and might we
have a discussion?

Thanks and Regards,
*Shambhavi Swarup*
